WinBASIC

Windows compiler for small subset of BASIC

This is a project that I've been working on to learn how to create a compiler. The source code is in Freebasic.
The compiler output is in fasm and uses the import routines from the windows msvcrt.dll.
It's a very incomplete project but can compile a couple of basic commands.
